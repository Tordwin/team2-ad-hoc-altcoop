## Schema

This repository now includes `addresses.sql`, which defines the MySQL schema for the `addresses` table.  

The schema includes:
- Core address fields: zipcode, number, street, street2, city, state, country
- Optional details: plus4, latitude, longitude, source
- A unique constraint to prevent duplicate addresses
- Indexes optimized for common queries (zipcode + number, state + city, latitude + longitude, etc.)

To load the schema into MySQL:

```bash
mysql -u <user> -p < addresses.sql
```

## Schema

This repository now includes `addresses.sql`, which defines the MySQL schema for the `addresses` table.  

The schema includes:
- Core address fields: zipcode, number, street, street2, city, state, country
- Optional details: plus4, latitude, longitude, source
- A unique constraint to prevent duplicate addresses
- Indexes optimized for common queries (zipcode + number, state + city, latitude + longitude, etc.)

To load the schema into MySQL:

```bash
mysql -u <user> -p < addresses.sql
```

## CSV to MySQL Import Script

This script imports rows from a CSV file into a MySQL database table.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)  
- [mysql-connector-python](https://pypi.org/project/mysql-connector-python/)

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas mysql-connector-python
```
### Usage

Run the script with the CSV file you want to import:
```python
python csv_to_mysql.py addresses_part1.csv
python csv_to_mysql.py addresses_part2.csv
python csv_to_mysql.py addresses_part3.csv
```

If successful, youâ€™ll see how many rows were inserted.
